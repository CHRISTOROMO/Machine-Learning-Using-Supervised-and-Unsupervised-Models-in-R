# Machine-Learning-Using-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Models-in-R

# 1. Project Description
## a). Supervised Machine Learning

We were tasked to create a supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in a blog. We used the Logistic regression model and Decision trees to model the data.

## b). Unsupervised Machine Learning

We were tasked to perform clustering using Unsupervised models then stating insights drawn from the analysis and visualizing the results. We used K-means and Hierachi

# 4. How to Install and Run the Project

We used R programming model purely to work with these models.

# 5. How to Use the Project

The project is purely for education purposes
